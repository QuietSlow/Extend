A quick update on Ithaca Nei Gong...

For the past few years I've been in SE Asia quite a bit, training with my teacher. I'm generally there for a few months in the spring and then again in the fall. When I'm not there (summer and winter), I'm usually back in Ithaca. I'm happy to teach when I'm here. I understand that it's doesn't work for everyone to have such an on-again/off-again schedule - but it's all I can offer right now.

I'll be away again from late February 2025. We'll have classes until I leave. Everyone is welcome. I hope to see you!

All the best,<br>
Mark
