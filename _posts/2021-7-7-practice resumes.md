As the public health crisis seems to be under control, I'll be resuming running Nei Gong classes. For the moment, I'll only be offering classes to folks that are fully vaccinated. If you're not vaccinated, but are serious about training, contact me and maybe we can arrange something.

Classes will be on Saturdays at 3pm, and the first class will be July 31st.

I'll be focusing on basics and foundations, moving at a pace appropriate for new students.
