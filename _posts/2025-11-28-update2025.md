A quick update on Ithaca Nei Gong...

For the past few years I've been in SE Asia quite a bit, training with my teacher and teaching Nei Gong to many wonderful people. I'm generally there for a few months in the spring and then again in the fall. When I'm not there (summer and winter), I'm usually back in Ithaca. I'm happy to teach when I'm here. I understand that it's doesn't work for everyone to have such an on-again/off-again schedule - but it's all I can offer right now.

I'll be back in the states at the start of December, so we'll have classes until I leave in late February 2026. Everyone is welcome. I hope to see you!

All the best,<br>
Mark
