To accommodate my own training schedule, the school will be taking a break from offering classes from early July into mid August. 

Unlike the days of our youth, when summer break may have been a time to forget about learning, I would encourage you to make this a time of deepening your practice. 

Folks who have been regularly attending classes here now have a wide palette to draw from in their private training: stretching, core work, qi gong, dao yin, and of course wuji.

One’s own daily training is the only gateway to progress. 

I’ll be training for seven hours a day. I hope that you’ll join me in spirit for part of that time.
