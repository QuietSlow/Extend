# Asheville, NC - August 2019
Over two days in August, Lotus Nei Gong instructors Erin Johnson and Mark Reichert will be teaching Daoist Nei Gong, a process of internal transformation. We will be using the method of Qi Gong - short, precise movement sequences and standing postures, as the vehicle for initiating this process.

An emphasis will be placed on helping participants bring this material into their own daily practice.

This course is applicable both for people completely new to Lotus Nei Gong and those with prior experience.

Please note that, though the training is often very rewarding, it can also be challenging and uncomfortable. The ideal student will be “adventurous of spirit”.


# When and Where
Training will be at [Town & Mountain Training Center](http://ashevilletrainingcenter.com/directions.html){:target="_blank"}, 261 Asheland Avenue, from 9am - 5pm on Sat/Sun, August 24/25. There will be a break for lunch each day.

Accommodations are not provided as part of the event. There are many available places to stay nearby.


# Sign up / Contact Us
The cost for the weekend will be $250.
If you would like to reserve a place on the course, or if you have any questions about the course, please email us at [lng.erinmark@gmail.com](mailto:lng.erinmark@gmail.com). Attendance will be limited to 25 students.



# More Information
Details on Lotus Nei Gong practices can be found [here](http://lotusneigong.com/qi-gong-nei-gong){:target="_blank"}. In particular, this course will draw from the [Level 1](http://lotusneigong.com/level-1-practice){:target="_blank"} material.


# Disclaimer
The Nei Gong process taught by Lotus Nei Gong is a classical process and is, at times, very strong. For this reason we do not wish for anybody with psychological disorders or those with serious medical issues/needs attend these events. There are many ‘medical’ Qi Gong schools out there that would be more appropriate for these kinds of needs. Nei Gong is also not suitable for pregnant women or anybody under the age of 18 years old. Lastly we reserve the right to ask any student to leave the training immediately if we deem the training to be unsuitable for them or a risk to their well-being. If any student attends a course such as this with known psychological disorders or medical issues that may put them at risk, they take full responsibility for their actions and any outcomes. Neither Lotus Nei Gong International nor its staff or instructors will be held accountable in such instances.
